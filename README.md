# Pet Care Management System üêæ

## Inspiration

This application was inspired by my personal experience of taking care of multiple pets and often forgetting their care schedules. As a pet owner, I found myself constantly worried about whether I had fed my cats, when was the last time I walked my dog, or when their next vet appointment should be. I realized that many pet owners face similar challenges in keeping track of their pets' needs, especially when they have multiple pets with different care requirements.

The idea came to me when I almost missed my cat's vaccination appointment and realized I hadn't been keeping proper track of my pets' health records. I wanted to create a simple but effective system that would help pet owners like me stay organized and ensure their furry friends get the best care possible.

## Data Storage

The application uses JSON files to store pet data persistently. The data includes:
- Pet information (name, age, breed, type-specific attributes)
- Care schedules with frequencies and last completion dates
- Health records with dates and descriptions

## Sample Data

The application comes with default care tasks for each pet type:
- **Dogs**: Daily walks, feeding, weekly baths, quarterly vet checkups
- **Cats**: Daily feeding, bi-daily litter cleaning, tri-daily brushing, quarterly vet checkups
- **Birds**: Daily feeding, tri-daily cage cleaning, monthly wing care, bi-annual vet checkups
